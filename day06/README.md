My code reads a qPCR csv file, takes the Ct number (which is the number of cycles that the machine ran) and converts it into gene expression. While it does this it ignores the runs that didn't succeed labeled as "undetermined". It creates a dataframe that includes the sample name, the target gene, the ct mean with the correlated gene expression.
The code then writes the dataframe to a new cvs file.
The test checks to see if in the dataframe the computation was done correctly.
